| Sampling                     | Define population and sample in the context of statistics.                                                                                                                                 |
| Visualize Samples            | Use scatterplots, histograms and the empirical CDF to visualize a sample.                                                                                                                             |
| Bootstrap                    | Compute bootstrap samples and use them to compute confidence intervals.                                                                                                                                   |

## Assignment

In this [assignment](assignment.md), you will work with the concept of sampling distributions though the lens of the bootstrap. You will use bootstrap method to create sampling distributions and derive confidence intervals.
